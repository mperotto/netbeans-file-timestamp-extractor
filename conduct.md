### Code of Conduct
# Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

# Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other community members
Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
Focusing on what is best for the community
Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment, threats, or intimidation
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
$ Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

# Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [insert email or contact information]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

# Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

# 1. Correction
Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

# 2. Warning
Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

# 3. Temporary Ban
Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

# 4. Permanent Ban Policy:

In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to permanently ban a user from our community. This action is taken only as a last resort when the user has repeatedly violated our code of conduct and other attempts to address their behavior have failed.

A permanent ban means that the user is no longer allowed to participate in any aspect of our community, including forums, chat rooms, and events. It is an irreversible action, and the user will not be allowed to create a new account.

Examples of behavior that can lead to a permanent ban include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment or threats of violence towards other community members
- Posting of sexually explicit or violent content
- Engaging in hate speech or discriminatory behavior
- Repeatedly violating the code of conduct despite warnings and interventions
We take the decision to impose a permanent ban very seriously and will do so only after careful consideration of all available evidence. We believe that this policy helps to ensure the safety and well-being of our community and promote a respectful and inclusive environment for all.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment of any kind, including but not limited to: deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Offensive or unwanted verbal comments, including but not limited to: sexual language or imagery, racial slurs, or derogatory language.
- Inappropriate physical contact or gestures.
- Bullying or threatening behavior.
- Discrimination, including but not limited to: discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Participants who engage in unacceptable behavior will be asked to stop and may be sanctioned or expelled from the project and its communication channels at the discretion of the project maintainers.

# Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the project maintainers as soon as possible. You can report the incident by contacting the project maintainers at [insert contact email or other contact information here].
